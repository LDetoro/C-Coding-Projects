# C++ Coding Projects
 
This repository contains various C++ programs covering fundamental concepts such as arithmetic operations, recursion, file handling, and algorithms. These programs were created as part of my coursework and personal projects to strengthen my understanding of C++ programming.  

## 📂 Contents  

### 🔢 Arithmetic & Math Operations  
- **[4operations.cpp](4operations.cpp)** - Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.  
- **[Div.cpp](Div.cpp)** - Simple division operation.  
- **[Mult&Add.cpp](Mult&Add.cpp)** - Multiplies two numbers and adds a constant value.  

### 🔠 String & Character Processing  
- **[palindrome.cpp](palindrome.cpp)** - Checks if a number is a palindrome.  
- **[alphatriangle.cpp](alphatriangle.cpp)** - Prints an alphabet triangle pattern.  
- **[Project2.cpp](Project2.cpp)** - Identifies vowels and consonants from user input.  
- **[Project6.cpp](Project6.cpp)** - Reads an input file and writes only vowels to an output file.  

### 🌀 Algorithms & Recursion  
- **[fibonacci.cpp](fibonacci.cpp)** - Generates Fibonacci series up to a given number.  

### 🏁 Miscellaneous  
- **[HelloWorld.cpp](HelloWorld.cpp)** - Simple "Hello, World!" program.  
- **[Maze.cpp](Maze.cpp)** - Implements a maze structure with functionalities for marking, checking open paths, and streaming input/output.
